# Text-Emotions-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
In machine learning, the detection of textual emotions is the problem of content-based classification, which is the task of natural language processing. Detecting
a personâ€™s emotions is a difficult task, but detecting the emotions using text written by a person is even more difficult as a human can express his emotions in any form.



Usually, emotions are expressed as joy, sadness, anger, surprise, hate, fear, etc. Recognizing this type of emotion from a text written by a person plays an important
role in applications such as chatbots, customer support forum, customer reviews etc. In the section below, I will take you through a machine learning project on Text
Emotions Detection using Python where I will build a machine learning model to classify the emotions of a text.
